# Elasticity-Labs-1
Labs on Elastic Load Balancers

## Description
<P> Elastic Load Balancing allows the distribution of incoming traffic to your Amazon AWS infrastructure across multiple instances. This represents a great tool in avoiding failures in your applications and web traffic. ELB automatically detects fails in your EC2 instances and redirects traffic to other available instances. During this Lab, you will learn to create and use your first ELB instance to balance the HTTP traffic between two EC2 instances. You will also gain a valuable understanding of the Classic Load Balancer behavior during an instance outage.

### Step 1: Select a load balancer type

<P> Elastic Load Balancing supports different types of load balancers. For this tutorial, we shall create a Classic Load Balancer.</p>

### To create a Classic Load Balancer

<P>  1.Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. On the navigation bar, choose a Region for your load balancer. Be sure to select the same Region that you selected for your EC2 instances.

3. On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

4. Choose Create Load Balancer.

5. For Classic Load Balancer, choose Create.
